# mycelium death, small chances for tree growth depending on age and
# tree type, sounds, killing area of oaks and willows, sprouting to
# adjacent tiles and mushrooms, several additional checks, and so on.
# In particular, watering a tree may not lead to growth and you will
# have to repeatedly try, possibly many times. Only use if you know that
# you want this.
